#Suppose that you’d like to implement a cookie jar in which to store cookies. In a file called jar.py, implement a class called Jar with these methods:
#__init__ should initialize a cookie jar with the given capacity, which represents the maximum number of cookies that can fit in the cookie jar. If capacity is not a non-negative int, though, __init__ should instead raise a ValueError.
#__str__ should return a str with 𝑛 🍪, where 𝑛 is the number of cookies in the cookie jar. For instance, if there are 3 cookies in the cookie jar, then str should return "🍪🍪🍪"
#deposit should add n cookies to the cookie jar. If adding that many would exceed the cookie jar’s capacity, though, deposit should instead raise a ValueError.
#withdraw should remove n cookies from the cookie jar. Nom nom nom. If there aren’t that many cookies in the cookie jar, though, withdraw should instead raise a ValueError.
#capacity should return the cookie jar’s capacity.
#size should return the number of cookies actually in the cookie jar, initially 0.
#Structure your class per the below. You may not alter these methods’ parameters, but you may add your own methods.
#class Jar:
#    def __init__(self, capacity=12):
#        ...
#    def __str__(self):
#        ...
#    def deposit(self, n):
#        ...
#    def withdraw(self, n):
#        ...
#    @property
#    def capacity(self):
#        ...
#    @property
#    def size(self):
#        ...
#Either before or after you implement jar.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_jar.py, four or more functions that collectively test your implementation of Jar thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

class Jar:
    def __init__(self, capacity=12):
        if type(capacity) is not int or capacity < 0:
            raise ValueError("Incorrect value")
        self._capacity = capacity
        self._size = 0

    def __str__(self):
        return "🍪" * self._size

    @property
    def size(self):
        return self._size

    @property
    def capacity(self):
        return self._capacity

    def deposit(self, n):
        if n + self._size > self._capacity or n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Max Capacity reached")
        self._size = self._size + n

    def withdraw(self, n):
        if self._size - n < 0 or n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Not enough cookies")
        self._size = self._size - n

    jar = Jar(10)
    print(jar)
